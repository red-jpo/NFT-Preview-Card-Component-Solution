## About this project

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

- Bootstrap isn't the best for everything and I don't particularly like how it makes the code look. I rather keep the styling separate.
- A way to make a hover overlay effect with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Chat Gpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - I've been using it as a tutor of sorts. If properly prompted, it can be very helpful in the learning process.

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

## Final Notes

At the start of the project, I tried to incorporate Bootstrap into every nook and cranny of the code, but it proved to be a very unnecessary headache. It's awesome to try new things, so it can be challenging to determine when they're causing more harm than good. Ultimately, I found that a simpler approach was better, I did though end up keeping a small portion of Bootstrap simply for personal preference.

All in all, it was a nice learning experience.
